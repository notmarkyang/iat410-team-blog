      <p>
        During weeks 1-2, we focused on refining out game concept and preparing for the Greenlight presentation. This was an important milestone for us, as it forced us to think critically about how we communicate our idea and what information is important early on.

      <p>
        While we were able to present our core concept, the presentation for the Greenlight left a lot to be desired. We left out some information out — such as combat images UI concepts — until the very end, which made it difficult to properly hook the critics and made it harder for them to fully understand how the game would function and feel.
