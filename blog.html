      <h2>Week 1–2: Project Setup</h2>

      <p>
        During weeks 1-2, we focused on refining out game concept and preparing for the Greenlight presentation. This was an important milestone for us, as it forced us to think critically about how we communicate our idea and what information is important early on.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we were able to present our core concept, the presentation for the Greenlight left a lot to be desired. We left out some information out — such as combat images UI concepts — until the very end, which made it difficult to properly hook the critics and made it harder for them to fully understand how the game would function and feel.
      </p>  
      <p>
        One thing that became clear through this process is that we need to be more aligned as a team moving forward. Some team members entered the course with an existing idea, and we didn’t have as much time as we should have to fully discuss and explore initial concepts together. This led to some gaps in shared understanding when it came time to present.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, we think as a team we have a solid foundation and the feedback we received was still valuable, giving us a clearer sense of what we need to improve. These lessons will be important moving on to the next stages as we move deeper into dwevelopment and start turning our concept into a more concrete and playable experience.
