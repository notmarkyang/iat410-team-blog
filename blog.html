      <h2>Week 1–2: Project Setup</h2>
      <p class="meta">Date: Jan 10, 2026</p>
      <p>
        During weeks 1-2, we focused on refining out game concept and preparing for the Greenlight presentation. This was an important milestone for us, as it forced us to think critically about how we communicate our idea and what information is important early on.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we were able to present our core concept, the presentation for the Greenlight left a lot to be desired. We left out some information out — such as combat images UI concepts — until the very end, which made it difficult to properly hook the critics and made it harder for them to fully understand how the game would function and feel.
      </p>  
      <p>
        One thing that became clear through this process is that we need to be more aligned as a team moving forward. Some team members entered the course with an existing idea, and we didn’t have as much time as we should have to fully discuss and explore initial concepts together. This led to some gaps in shared understanding when it came time to present.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the next few weeks, we’ll be pushing further into development by laying the groundwork for the platformer and side-scroller aspects of the game. We’ll be starting on basic movement and core mechanics, while our artists begin creating the assets we’ll need. This should help us better visualize the game and give us something more concrete to build on moving forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, we think as a team we have a solid foundation and the feedback we received was still valuable, giving us a clearer sense of what we need to improve. These lessons will be important moving on to the next stages as we move deeper into dwevelopment and start turning our concept into a more concrete and playable experience.

      <h2>Week 3–6: Prototype to playable</h2>
      <p class="meta">Date: Feb 10, 2026</p>
      <p>
        Weeks 3–6 was where the project really shifted from plan to real development. Early on, we focused on prototyping basic player movement using placeholder assets. Selena and Mark worked on getting the player moving, jumping, and interacting with the environment, while Lynn began creating and preparing visual assets for the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once movement was in place, we moved into the first major implementation stage; Lynn brought in environmental assets to build out a basic game world layout, which included the side-scrolling section and a platforming map. At the same time, Mark and Selena continued refining player movement and began adding core gameplay systems such as health, enemy damage, and environmental hazards. This helped establish the foundation of our game and provided something concrete to playtest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, development shifted toward expanding gameplay. Selena and Mark worked on adding more complex enemies with different attack behaviors and basic scripts. Around this time, Ren set up Ink for dialogue and implemented early narrative elements into the side-scrolling section to support the core loop. Chisa replaced placeholder UI with a responsive health bar and began integrating mood indicators, which was another big step for the game's visual feedback and clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The planned final stage was intended to complete the core loop by introducing the mood system (basic modifiers and display), further refining the UI, and implementing a win condition. Unfortunately, we were unable to fully reach this stage due to workflow challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        This period also marked our first experience collaborating using GitHub and GitHub Desktop, which came with a learning curve. As beginners to version control, we encountered merge conflicts, workflow issues, and delays caused by overlapping changes and late merges. While this created pressure near the deadline, it became an important learning experience that highlighted the need for clearer communication and more consistent integration practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite these challenges, we produced a playable build that brought together movement, enemies, UI, interactions, and early narrative elements. More importantly, everyone gained valuable experience working through real development constraints and iterating collaboratively. These lessons will help guide future development as the project moves toward refining mechanics, improving polish, and strengthening team workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving forward, we will focus on completing the core gameplay loop and improving overall polish. This includes finishing the mood system, refining UI elements, implementing a win condition, and continuing to tune movement and combat to improve game feel. With the foundation now in place, the next phase will prioritize stability, playtesting, and iteration based on feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also plan to improve workflow practices by merging more frequently, communicating changes more clearly, and maintaining cleaner branches in GitHub to avoid last-minute integration issues. These adjustments should help streamline development and make collaboration smoother going into the next milestone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, the goal for the upcoming weeks is to transition from building systems to refining the experience — focusing on feel, clarity, and cohesion as the project moves closer to a complete playable prototype.
