            <p>
                Weeks 3–6 was where the project really shifted from plan to real development. Early on, we focused on
                prototyping basic player movement using placeholder assets. Selena and Mark worked on getting the player
                moving, jumping, and interacting with the environment, while Lynn began creating and preparing visual
                assets for the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once movement was in place, we moved into the first major implementation stage; Lynn brought in
                environmental assets to build out a basic game world layout, which included the side-scrolling section
                and a platforming map. At the same time, Mark and Selena continued refining player movement and began
                adding core gameplay systems such as health, enemy damage, and environmental hazards. This helped
                establish the foundation of our game and provided something concrete to playtest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, development shifted toward expanding gameplay. Selena and Mark worked on adding more complex
                enemies with different attack behaviors and basic scripts. Around this time, Ren set up Ink for dialogue
                and implemented early narrative elements into the side-scrolling section to support the core loop. Chisa
                replaced placeholder UI with a responsive health bar and began integrating mood indicators, which was
                another big step for the game's visual feedback and clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The planned final stage was intended to complete the core loop by introducing the mood system (basic
                modifiers and display), further refining the UI, and implementing a win condition. Unfortunately, we
                were unable to fully reach this stage due to workflow challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                This period also marked our first experience collaborating using GitHub and GitHub Desktop, which came
                with a learning curve. As beginners to version control, we encountered merge conflicts, workflow issues,
                and delays caused by overlapping changes and late merges. While this created pressure near the deadline,
                it became an important learning experience that highlighted the need for clearer communication and more
                consistent integration practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite these challenges, we produced a playable build that brought together movement, enemies, UI,
                interactions, and early narrative elements. More importantly, everyone gained valuable experience
                working through real development constraints and iterating collaboratively. These lessons will help
                guide future development as the project moves toward refining mechanics, improving polish, and
                strengthening team workflows.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving forward, we will focus on completing the core gameplay loop and improving overall polish. This
                includes finishing the mood system, refining UI elements, implementing a win condition, and continuing
                to tune movement and combat to improve game feel. With the foundation now in place, the next phase will
                prioritize stability, playtesting, and iteration based on feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also plan to improve workflow practices by merging more frequently, communicating changes more
                clearly, and maintaining cleaner branches in GitHub to avoid last-minute integration issues. These
                adjustments should help streamline development and make collaboration smoother going into the next
                milestone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, the goal for the upcoming weeks is to transition from building systems to refining the
                experience — focusing on feel, clarity, and cohesion as the project moves closer to a complete playable
                prototype.
            </p>
