            <p>
                During weeks 1-2, we focused on refining out game concept and preparing for the Greenlight presentation.
                This was an important milestone for us, as it forced us to think critically about how we communicate our
                idea and what information is important early on.
            </p>
            <p>
                While we were able to present our core concept, the presentation for the Greenlight left a lot to be
                desired. We left out some information out — such as combat images UI concepts — until the very end,
                which made it difficult to properly hook the critics and made it harder for them to fully understand how
                the game would function and feel.
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing that became clear through this process is that we need to be more aligned as a team moving
                forward. Some team members entered the course with an existing idea, and we didn’t have as much time as
                we should have to fully discuss and explore initial concepts together. This led to some gaps in shared
                understanding when it came time to present.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the next few weeks, we’ll be pushing further into development by laying the groundwork for the
                platformer and side-scroller aspects of the game. We’ll be starting on basic movement and core
                mechanics, while our artists begin creating the assets we’ll need. This should help us better visualize
                the game and give us something more concrete to build on moving forward.
            </p>
            <p>
                That said, we think as a team we have a solid foundation and the feedback we received was still
                valuable, giving us a clearer sense of what we need to improve. These lessons will be important moving
                on to the next stages as we move deeper into dwevelopment and start turning our concept into a more
                concrete and playable experience.
